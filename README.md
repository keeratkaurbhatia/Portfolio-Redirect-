# portfolio — redirect

a tiny doorway so linkedin stops breaking my preview.

this repo only does three things:
1. holds a thumbnail  
2. sets the og tags  
3. pushes you straight to my portfolio  

## about my portfolio  
part code, part creativity, part chaos.  
projects i’ve built, experiments i love,  
and the little ascii things that make me smile.

if you land here, you’re meant to go there:
